# Azure Lightsaber

A tool of an Azure Architect. Not as clumsy or random as a UI. An elegant tool for a civilized age.

It helps to quickly bootstrap the tools necessary to deploy Azure services from command line via scripts, by providing a consistent x-platform Docker Image that contains the following tools:
- azure-cli (2.0 aka azure-python-cli)
- powershell
- terraform
- packer
- ansible
